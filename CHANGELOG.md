## [2.1.0 - Cafu] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- `.sonarcloud.properties`: SonarCloud Automatic Analysis configuration —
  sources, tests, coverage exclusions aligned with `codecov.yml` (#239)
- `.dockerignore`: added `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.coderabbit.yaml`,
  `.sonarcloud.properties`, `.sonarlint/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`
  (#239)
- `docs/adr/`: 10 Architecture Decision Records documenting key design choices — layered architecture, Gin, GORM, SQLite, UUID v4 primary key, squad number as mutation identifier, single domain struct with dedicated request binding type, full update semantics (PUT / PATCH deferred to #172), in-memory cache strategy, and mixed test strategy (closes #162)
- CD workflow (`go-cd.yml`): added "Verify tag commit is reachable from master" step to `deploy` job — fails early with a descriptive error if the tag's commit is not an ancestor of `origin/master` (closes #231)
- `.claude/commands/prerelease.md`: `/prerelease` slash command implementing a three-phase pre-release checklist — determine next version and player codename, prepare release branch and CHANGELOG, tag and push (closes #233)
- `.claude/commands/precommit.md`: step 1 marked as skippable when CHANGELOG has already been updated as part of release branch preparation (closes #233)

### Changed

- Player dataset normalised to November 2022 World Cup snapshot: Di María `abbrPosition` → `RW`, Mac Allister `team` → Brighton & Hove Albion, Fernández team/league → SL Benfica / Liga Portugal, Messi team/league → Paris Saint-Germain / Ligue 1 (closes #227)
- All player UUIDs migrated to canonical UUID v5 (namespace `f201b13e-c670-473d-885d-e2be219f74c8`, formula `{firstName}-{lastName}`) (closes #227)
- Test fixture for Create/Delete replaced: Paredes (squad 5) → Lo Celso (squad 27) (closes #227)
- `MakeUpdatePlayer()` added to `player_fake.go`: Emiliano Martínez (squad 23) (closes #227)
- DELETE test restructured: Armani (squad 1) → Lo Celso (squad 27) via POST+DELETE pattern (closes #227)
- GET by squad number body assertion retargeted to Messi (squad 10) (closes #227)
- `rest/players.rest` updated: `@newSquadNumber = 27`, `@existingSquadNumber = 23` (closes #227)

### Removed

- `sonar-project.properties`: replaced by `.sonarcloud.properties` for
  SonarCloud Automatic Analysis compatibility (#239)

## [2.0.0 - Bobby] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- `GET /players/{id}` now accepts a UUID string (surrogate key) instead of an integer ID
- `tools/seed_001_starting_eleven.go`, `tools/seed_002_substitutes.go`: `//go:build ignore` standalone Go programs to drop, recreate, and reseed the SQLite database using GORM; numbered to mirror the future Goose migration sequence
- `rest/players.rest`: HTTP request file covering health check, POST, GET all, GET by ID, GET by squad number, PUT, and DELETE — compatible with VS Code REST Client (`humao.rest-client`) and JetBrains built-in HTTP Client
- `humao.rest-client` listed in `.vscode/extensions.json` recommended extensions

### Changed

- **BREAKING** `Player.ID` field changed from `int` to `string` to hold a UUID v4; the server always generates the ID on POST — any client-provided value is overwritten
- **BREAKING** `PUT /players/:squadnumber` and `DELETE /players/:squadnumber` now identify players by `squadNumber` (user-facing unique identifier) instead of internal ID; clients must update URLs from `/players/:id` to `/players/:squadnumber`
- **BREAKING** `GET /players/{id}` parameter type changed from integer to UUID string
- `uniqueIndex` GORM tag added to `Player.SquadNumber` — uniqueness is now enforced at DB level, not only in application logic
- Test fixtures (`tests/players.json`) migrated from integer IDs to deterministic UUID v5 strings derived from `squadNumber` using a project-specific namespace
- SQLite database (`storage/players-sqlite3.db`) re-seeded with UUID v4 primary keys to match the new schema
- Updated `codecov.yml` ignore list: replaced `postman-collections/**/*` with `rest/**/*`
- Updated `README.md`: replaced Postman Collection section with HTTP Requests section referencing `rest/players.rest`

### Removed

- Integer auto-increment `id` — the `id` field is now a server-assigned opaque UUID v4 string
- `postman-collections/` directory and Postman collection JSON file

### Fixed

- Eliminated variable shadowing in `Put` and `Delete` handlers: inner `err :=` assignments replaced with `err =` to reuse the outer declaration

### Migration Notes

This release changes the database schema in a **backwards-incompatible** way.
An existing `players-sqlite3.db` with integer primary keys will fail at startup because `AutoMigrate` cannot alter a column type in SQLite.
Re-create the database from scratch using the provided seed scripts:

```bash
# Drop and reseed with starting-eleven players (squad numbers 1–11)
go run tools/seed_001_starting_eleven.go

# Append substitute players (squad numbers 12–23)
go run tools/seed_002_substitutes.go
```

Both scripts use `//go:build ignore` so they are excluded from normal `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` runs.
Run them only when you need to recreate the local SQLite database.
